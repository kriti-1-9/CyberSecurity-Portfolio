# 🧠 Challenge: head-dump (picoCTF 2025)
## Category: Web Exploitation (Easy)

## 📝 Description

The challenge required exploring a blog-style web application and finding an endpoint that exposes a file containing the server's memory. The goal was to locate a hidden flag inside that memory dump.

### 🔍 Step 1: Reconnaissance
- Launched challenge instance
- Explored homepage
- Looked for hidden/debug endpoints
- Identified an exposed heap dump endpoint
- Discovered endpoint:
```
/heapdump
``` 

### 📥 Step 2: Download Heap Snapshot
- Accessing the endpoint downloaded:
```
heapdump-XXXXXXXX.heapsnapshot
```
- This is a memory dump of the server process.

### 🧪 Step 3: Extract Strings from Memory
- Heap snapshots are large and not clean JSON.
- Instead of parsing JSON, we extracted readable strings:
```
strings heapdump-XXXXXXXX.heapsnapshot | grep -E "picoCTF\{.*\}"
```

### 🏁 Step 4: Flag
- The flag was found directly inside the memory dump.

## 💡 Key Lesson
Memory dumps often contain:
- Secrets
- API keys
- Flags
- Environment variables
