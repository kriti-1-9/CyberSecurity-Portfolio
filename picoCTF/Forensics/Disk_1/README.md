# Overview

In this challenge, we were given a compressed disk image file:

disko-1.dd.gz


The objective was to analyze the disk image and recover the hidden flag.

This challenge tested raw disk image handling, filesystem identification, and deleted file recovery concepts.

Step 1 – Decompress the Disk Image
gunzip disko-1.dd.gz


This produced:

disko-1.dd

Step 2 – Identify the Filesystem

We analyzed the file type:

file disko-1.dd


The output indicated:

FAT (32 bit)


This confirmed the disk image contained a FAT32 filesystem.

Step 3 – Partition Analysis

Attempting to list partitions:

mmls disko-1.dd


No output was produced, indicating that:

There was no partition table

The filesystem started directly at offset 0

Step 4 – Mount the Disk Image

The image was mounted for inspection:

mkdir mount
sudo mount -o loop disko-1.dd mount
ls mount


A /bin directory was present, containing many system binaries.
Manual browsing was inefficient due to the large number of files.

Step 5 – Search Raw Disk Data

Instead of manually exploring mounted directories, we searched the entire raw disk image:

strings disko-1.dd | grep pico


This successfully revealed the flag.

# Why This Worked

-> FAT32 does not securely wipe deleted files

-> Deleted file contents often remain in raw disk sectors

-> Mounted filesystems only show active files

-> strings extracts printable ASCII directly from binary data

-> By searching the raw image instead of the mounted filesystem, we were able to recover hidden or deleted data.

# Key Concepts Learned

-> Disk images can be analyzed directly without mounting

-> strings is powerful in forensic analysis

-> Deleted files may still exist in raw disk sectors

-> Understanding filesystem behavior is critical in CTF forensics challenges
