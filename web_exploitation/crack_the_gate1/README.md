# Challenge: Crack the Gate 1 (Web Exploitation)
**Date:** Tuesday, February 17, 2026  
**Category:** Web Security / Cryptanalysis  

## Problem Overview
A restricted web portal was discovered with an unknown password. The challenge description hinted at a "secret way in" left by a developer.

## Analysis & Discovery
1.  **Source Code Audit:** Inspected the HTML source and found a hidden comment:
    ``
2.  **Cryptanalysis:** Identified the encoding as **ROT13**. 
    - Decoded string: `NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"`
3.  **Exploitation Strategy:** Realized the server-side logic allowed authentication bypass if a specific HTTP header (`X-Dev-Access`) was present.

## Solution
Developed a Python script using the `requests` library to:
- Set the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.
- Inject the custom `X-Dev-Access: yes` header.
- Send a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint with dummy credentials.

The server validated the bypass header and returned the flag in the JSON response.

## Key SDE Takeaway
Hardcoded backdoors and "debug" headers are significant security risks. As an engineer, always ensure that environment-specific bypasses are stripped during the CI/CD pipeline before pushing to production.
